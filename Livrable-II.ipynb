    "ADEME (French Environment and Energy Management Agency) has recently launched a call for expressions of interest to promote the execution of demos and experiments of new mobility solutions for people and goods, adapted to different kinds of territories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your CesiCDP structure is already well established in the field. With the help of many partners, you have carried out several studies on Smart Multimodal Mobility. New transport technologies, despite being more cost-effective and cleaner, also pose new challenges, particularly in terms of resource management optimization. But these transport logistics problems present a major challenge for the future: they can be applied in many areas (mail distribution, product delivery, road network maintenance, garbage collection) and their impact on the environment can be truly significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are part of the team set up by CesiCDP to answer the call from ADEME. The challenge is to win new markets with very attractive financing schemes to keep developing your business activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "CesiCDP decided to focus its study on the management of delivery routes. The algorithmic problem consists in calculating on a road network a route allowing to connect a subset of cities between them, then to return to its starting point, so as to minimize the total duration of the route. This optimization should take into account the expected traffic on each axis for the different time slots.\n",

    "The idea is to propose a method from Operations Research to generate a delivery route corresponding to this problem.\n"
